# Chapter 1. Introduction

In which we try to explain why we consider artificial intelligence to be a subject most worthy of study, and in which we try to decide what exactly it is, this being a good thing to decide before embarking.

## Notes

### 1.1 What is AI?

- AI defenitions are divided in a (2*2) matrix, the first row is concerned with "thought processes and reasoning" while the second is concerned with "behavior". On the other hand, the first column is about "fidelity to human performance" and the second is about "rationality".
- Different people approach AI with different goals in mind. Two important questions to ask are: Are you concerned with thinking or behavior? Do you want to model humans or work from an ideal standard?
- 
|Thinking Humanly| Thinking Rationally |
|--|--|
| “The exciting new effort to make computers think . . . machines with minds, in the full and literal sense.” (Haugeland, 1985) | “The study of mental faculties through the use of computational models.” (Charniak and McDermott, 1985) |
|“[The automation of] activities that we associate with human thinking, activities such as decision-making, problem solving, learning . . .” (Bellman, 1978) | “The study of the computations that make it possible to perceive, reason, and act.” (Winston, 1992)

|Acting Humanly|Acting Rationally|
|--|--|
| “The art of creating machines that perform functions that require intelligence when performed by people.” (Kurzweil, 1990)|  “Computational Intelligence is the study of the design of intelligent agents.” (Poole et al., 1998)  |
|“The study of how to make computers do things at which, at the moment, people are better.” (Rich and Knight, 1991) | “AI . . . is concerned with intelligent behavior in artifacts.” (Nilsson, 1998)

#### 1.1.1 Acting humanly: The Turing Test approach

- Turing Test: A computer passes the test if a human interrogator, after posing some written questions, cannot tell whether the written responses come from a person or from a computer.
- Computer capabilities to pass the test:
	- Natural Language Processing (NLP): to enable it to communicate successfully in English.
	- Knowledge Representation:  to store what it knows or hears.
	- Automated Reasoning: to use the stored information to answer questions and to draw new conclusions
	- Machine Learning (ML): to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns.
- Total Turing Test includes a video signal so that the interrogator can test the subject’s perceptual abilities, as well as the opportunity for the interrogator to pass physical objects.
- To pass the total Turing Test, the computer will need:
	- Computer Vision: to perceive objects.
	- Robotics: to manipulate objects and move about.
- It is more important to study the underlying principles of intelligence than to duplicate an exemplar.

#### 1.1.2 Thinking humanly: The cognitive modeling approach

- How the determine the mechanism of human thinking throgh getting inside the human mind in 3 ways
	- Introspection: trying to catch our own thoughts as they go by.
	- Psychological experiments: observing a person in action.
	- Brain imaging: observing the brain in action.
- The interdisciplinary field of cognitive science brings together computer models from AI and experimental techniques from psychology to construct precise and testable theories of the human mind.

#### 1.1.3 Thinking rationally: The “laws of thought” approach

- The Greek philosopher Aristotle syllogisms provided patterns for argument structures that always yielded correct conclusions when given correct premises (initiated the field called logic).
- The logicist tradition within artificial intelligence hopes to build on such programs to create intelligent systems.
	- It is not easy to take informal knowledge and state it in the formal terms required by logical notation.
	- There is a big difference between solving a problem “in principle” and solving it in practice.

#### 1.1.4 Acting rationally: The rational agent approach

- An agent is just something that acts. Computer agents are expected to do more.
	- Operate autonomously.
	- Perceive their environment.
	- Persist over a prolonged time period.
	- Adapt to change.
	- Create and pursue goals.
- A rational agent is one that acts so as to achieve the best outcome or, when there is uncertainty, the best expected outcome.
- In this book, they adopt the view that intelligence is concerned mainly with rational action. Ideally, an intelligent agent takes the best possible action in a situation.

### 1.2 The Foundations of Artificial Intelligence
- The disciplines that contributed ideas, viewpoints, and techniques to AI.
	- Philosophy
		- Can formal rules be used to draw valid conclusions?
		- How does the mind arise from a physical brain?
		- Where does knowledge come from?
		- How does knowledge lead to action?
	- Mathematics
		- What are the formal rules to draw valid conclusions?
		- What can be computed?
		- How do we reason with uncertain information?
	- Economics
		- How should we make decisions so as to maximize payoff?
		-  How should we do this when others may not go along?
		- How should we do this when the payoff may be far in the future?
	- Neuroscience
		- How do brains process information?
	- Psychology
		- How do humans and animals think and act?
	- Computer engineering
		- How can we build an efficient computer?
	- Control theory and cybernetics
		- How can artifacts operate under their own control?
	- Linguistics
		- How does language relate to thought?

### 1.3 The History of Artificial Intelligence

- The history of AI has had cycles of success, misplaced optimism, and resulting cutbacks in enthusiasm and funding. There have also been cycles of introducing new creative approaches and systematically refining the best ones.
- AI has advanced more rapidly in the past decade because of greater use of the scientific method in experimenting with and comparing approaches.

### 1.4 The State of the Art
- What can AI do today?
	- Robotic vehicles.
	- Speech recognition.
	- Autonomous planning and scheduling.
	- Game playing.
	- Spam fighting.
	- Logistics planning.
	- Robotics.
	- Machine Translation.
