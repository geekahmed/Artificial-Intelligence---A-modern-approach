# Chapter 2. Intelligent Agents
In which we discuss the nature of agents, perfect or otherwise, the diversity of environments, and the resulting menagerie of agent types.
## Notes
### 2.1 Agents and Environments
- An agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators.
- The term percept is used to refer to the agent’s perceptual inputs at any given instant. 
- An agent’s percept sequence is the complete history of everything the agent has ever perceived.
- The agent’s behavior is described by the agent function that maps any given percept sequence to an action.
- The agent function is an abstract mathematical description; the agent program is a concrete implementation, running within some physical system.
